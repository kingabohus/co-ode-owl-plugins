# Taxonomy Cut+Paste #

## Description ##
Sometimes, all you need is a quick extract of a part of your hierarchy for a paper or presentation.
These 2 very simple views provide a quick way to extract parts of your hierarchy into text form.

A short [tutorial](http://www.co-ode.org/downloads/protege-x/plugin-code-example.php) shows how these views were created.

### Tabbed Subclasses view ###
Shows a tab-indented list of your asserted class hierarchy from the currently selected class

### Decendant Names view ###
Does the same without indentation. Just cut and paste into your favourite applications.
