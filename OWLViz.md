## Description ##
The popular OWLViz visualization plug-in has been ported from Protege 3.x to Protege 4.x. Implemented as a view, the subsumption graph can now be shown on any tab. In addition, a new imports graph is available to help understand the import dependencies within highly modularised ontologies.
