## Description ##
Forever getting lost in large ontologies? Or, want to keep a set of classes/properties handy for a demo? Drag classes/properties into this view and they are accessable anytime to click on. They will also be saved along with your ontology annotations for future reference.

## Features ##
  * Drag and drop entities on to the bookmarks view
  * If the ontology is saved the bookmarks are also saved as ontology annotations
