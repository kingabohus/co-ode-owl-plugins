# Plugin Installation #

## Using <a>auto-update</a> (from build 104 onwards) ##
  * Start P4. If P4 is set to check for updates on startup you will get a dialog pop up automatically.
  * At any time during a session open preferences and select the plugins tab. You can check for updates or new plugins.
  * elect any plugins you want installed. Once they have been downloaded you will be prompted that the plugins will be available on a restart

## Manually (for plugins that have not enabled auto-update) ##
  * Get the <a href='http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html#p4'>latest release of Protege 4.0</a>
  * Download and unzip plugins into the Protege plugins/ folder

## Finding/using plugins ##
  * Next time you start Protege, the plugin will be loaded (if you have a console open you will see a message about each plugin that has been found).
  * Accessing the plugin depends on the type - many will be available as additional tabs in the **Tabs** menu or as views in the **View** menu. Each of our plugins gives details about where to find it.

### View Plugins ###
  * Clicking on a plugin in the **Views** menu puts the user in configure mode, allowing them to drop the view anywhere on the current tab.
  * Views can be stacked, floated, cloned and removed to make up your own interface (see <a href='http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Protege4GettingStarted#Reconfigure_the_User_Interface'>protege wiki</a> for instructions).

## Updating plugins ##
  * One more nice feature of the framework is that most plugins you have installed will tell you when an update is available from the web
(see <a>protege wiki</a>).
