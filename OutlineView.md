# Outline/Existential Tree Views #

## Description ##
The subsumption hierarchy is not the only "axis" on which an ontology relies. Many other axis (such as partOf) can be useful for navigation.

### Outline View ###
Follows existential (and appropriate cardinality) restrictions to build up a view of the current class by its structure.

### Existential Tree view ###
A simplified version that shows the tree along a specified property.

To enable this view select the single property you wish to follow by using the action on the view's toolbar.

### Reverse Existential Tree view ###
Shows the existential tree for named classes in the opposite direction to which the restrictions were placed.

This can be useful for anatomy or other meronomies where you wish to see the structure from the root (eg body) but all statements are in the form Lungs -> partOf some Chest.

To enable this view select the single property you wish to follow by using the action on the view's toolbar


## Features ##
