# OBO Tools #

## Description ##
A set of extensions to Protege that make it easier for OBO ontology developers to find their way around and edit OBO ontologies in OWL.

In the OBO2OWL translation obsoleted terms have no parents and are marked with an annotation to say that they have been deprecated. This means they can get in the way when tools don't take them into account.


## Features ##

Several views have been implemented:

### OBO Class Hierarchy View ###
This display is exactly like the asserted class hierarchy, but with obsoleted root terms removed to make the remaining hierarchy clearer.

### OBO Obsolete terms View ###
A view for listing the obsolete terms separately from the rest of the hierarchy.
