# Cloud Views #

## Description ##
Wondering about the "shape" of your ontology? Several implementations of the popular TagCloud can give you insight into different aspects of your ontology - ratings are based on different criteria:

  * usage
  * depth in hierarchy
  * restriction count (that is, how many anonymous superclasses a class has)
  * descendant count
  * sibling count
  * interval rank (thanks to Julian Seidenberg)

The bigger the name, the higher the rating. Sort alphabetically or by rating, and filter out low ranking entities easily.

## Features ##
  * All entities are hyperlinked so this view can be used as a navigation tool
  * Tooltips show the rating of the entity under the cursor
  * Sort alphabetically or by importance
  * Exaggerate the importance of higher rated entities (zoom)
  * Print the cloud
